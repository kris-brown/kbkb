\title{Subjunctive conditionals as essential}
``We've established not only that subjunctive conditionals are the expressions of material rules of inference, but that the authority of those rules is not derivative from formal rules. In other words, we've shown that material rules of inference are essential to the language we speak, for we make constant use of subjunctive conditions. It's very tempting to conclude that material rules of inference are essential to languages containing descriptive terms."
