\title{Labeling vs Describing}
``It's only because the expressions in terms of which we describe objects locate
them in a space of implications that they \emph{describe} at all, rather than
merely \emph{label}."

\begin{itemize}
    \item Describing is what science is the measure of all things about.
    \item You can't do everything with just classification. It's not a rich
         enough concept to get you to descriptions.
\end{itemize}
