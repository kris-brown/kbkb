\title{Man as rational animal}
``To say that man is a rational animal is to say that man is a creature not of
habits but of rules. When God created Atom he whispered in his ear `In all
contexts of action you will recognize rules, if only the rule to grope for rules
to recognize. when you cease to recognize rules you will walk on four feet.' ''
