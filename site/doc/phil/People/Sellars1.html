One does indeed describe him, but one does something more. And it’s this ‘something more’ which is the irreducible core of the framework of persons. In what does this ‘something more’ consist? To think of a featherless bird as a person is to think of it as a being with which one is bound up in a network of duties. From this point of view, the irreducibility of the personal is the irreducibility of the <em>ought</em> or the <em>is</em>. But even more basic than this to think of a featherless biped as a person is to construe its behavior in terms of actual or potential membership in an embracing group, each member of which thinks of itself as a member of the group.

<div id="docphilpeoplesellarsquotesnondescriptiveconcepts.htmlnondescriptive-concepts"><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">“Once the tautology ‘the world is described by descriptive concepts’ is freed from the idea that the business of all non-logical concepts is to describe, the way is clear to an ungrudging recognition that many expressions which empiricists have relegated to second-class citizenship in discourse are not inferior, they’re just different.&#34;</p><ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<li><p><em>Descriptive</em> concepts are not the only kinds of concepts. There is a temptation of empiricists in assimilating all expressions to descriptive expressions (such that anything not intelligible as descriptive is defective).</p></li>
<li><p>The negation of this is called <em>decriptivism</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>The Tractatus was supremely descriptivist, yet made a key advance by noting that logical expressions play a different kind of role (prior to Tractatus, Russell would be looking into the world to try to see what distinguishes positive from negative facts, when he should not have been looking to the world).</p></li>
<li><p>Sellars extends this even further. The later Wittgenstein saw language as playing an unsurveyable variety of roles.</p></li>
<li><p>Most interesting philosophical concepts come with a “-ing” “-ed” distinction that’s crucial. Is a justification an act of justifying vs what’s justified (related Agrippean trilemma). Is an experience an act of experiencing vs what’s experienced.</p></li>

To be able to think is to be able to measure one’s thoughts by standards of correctness, of relevance, of evidence (NB: in the space of justification). In this sense the diversified conceptual framework is a whole which (however sketchy) is prior to its parts, and cannot be construed as a coming to gether of parts which are conceptual in character. The conclusion is difficult to avoid that the transition from preconceptual patterns of behavior to conceptual thinking is a holistic one, a jump to a level of awareness that is irreducibly new. A jump which was the coming of the being of man.&#34; - Constrast with Wittegnsteining image of “light dawning slowly on the whole&#34;. Sellars is worried about the mechanism of how this happens.</p><div class="references csl-bib-body hanging-indent" id="refs" role="doc-bibliography" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
