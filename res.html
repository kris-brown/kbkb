<div id="docphilphilsituationsbeewaggle.htmlbee-waggle"><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When a foraging bee discovers a supply of food, it returns to the hive and does a waggle dance. The rest of the hive then flies out in a certain direction and distance to locate the food. In some sense, the bee communicates the information of the food supply to the hive.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Can’t we explain why a particular bee on one occasion does that by invoking the pattern that it’s an instance of? What would it mean to say of a bee returning from a food source that it’s turnings and wiggling has occurred <em>because</em> they’re part of a complete dance? This is related to distinction of pattern governed vs rule obeying behavior. (cite some reflections on language games) Ruth milliken, Sellars student, devotes her career to this, developing the field of teleosemantics and writing about it in Language, Thought, and Other Biological Categories.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A simpler example than the bee one for this is that beavers slap their tail when there’s danger and beavers flee when they hear another beaver slap its tail.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The idea of teleosemantics is an evolutionary sort of semantics. Acknowledge language use is normative (make distinction between correct and incorrect use). You have to draw the distinction in the way that’s compatible with any degree of badness of the participants actually following the rules. We look at a reproductive family, the normal explanation (a tehcnial term) of tail slapping is that, in the evolutionary history, lives were saved by it. When the explanation of the persistence of tail slapping turns on particular eventsi n the past where things worked well that way (expressed in terms of counterfactuals - no tail slap, then species dies out), then we can say its part of the proper function (technical term) to perform that behavior. This solves some puzzle cases: it allows us to say the proper function of sperm is to fertilize eggs even if a vanishingly small fraction of them actually do (because if they hadn’t fertilized eggs in the past, there wouldn’t be sperm now).</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Well, this is the form of explanation for semantics, not a beaver tail slaps that aren’t involved in more complicated interactions than that. Because the same thing can happen when the reproductive families are uses of words. Where you can explain why, you know, we use the word Aristotle, as we do, if has having a proper function of, in the end, referring to Aristotle, because if people in the past had not used it, in particular ways, we wouldn’t be using it today. And similarly, for predicates, and so on. She says, These are not biological norms. But we can understand words as having proper functions in the same sense in which even in the merely biological case, we can understand things as having proper functions. And we can understand them as having proper signaling functions. So there’s a proper function for producing these things and a proper function for receiving them. There, the analogy of the of the tail slaps is a good one.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">But in order to get semantic cut to understand semantic content, we don’t need to use any principles of explanation that aren’t already intelligible</p></div></details><details id="docphilphilsituationschildrensgame.htmlchildrens-game" open="open" xmlns="">

<div id="docphilphilsituationsclassicalbehaviorism.htmlclassical-behaviorism"><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This is related to the problem of: suppose you follow a rule. You use a representation of that rule to train the next generation to follow the rule. How do we know that the same rule is being passed on? Isn’t it like a game of telephone, given the ambiguity of following rules (gerrymandering problem - you have a rule in your head and punish me for lifting the glass of water, but I interpret this as punishment for lifting my arm or one of a million other possible explanations). Brandom’s response:</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Well, maybe so and maybe it a given rule isn’t as stable as we think. I mean, it’s only if it had enough coherence and enough stability, that we’re here. (Anthropomorphic principle). And when Wittgenstein harps on this, you know, unless as a matter of fact, we tended to go on the same way when trained the same way, to a remarkable extent, we wouldn’t get a language game off the ground.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">I should mention that this gerrymandering issue is what was wrong with classical behaviorism from an empirical point of view. <a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Remember, the stimulus and response were supposed to be objective features of the critters you were looking at. So that the behavioral scientist modeled on the natural scientist, her own conceptual scheme was not supposed to be involved in characterizing the behavior of these critters. But if you ask sort of classical studies, so I take the rat, and set him down four steps away from the bar, and train him, then if he walks four steps forward and presses down on the bar, he’ll get a rat yummy. And that stimulus, let’s say, the light goes on, walks, four steps, pushes down on the bar gets a rat yummy. We indoctrinate him with that, conditioned learning, he can do that. And now we ask the behavioral scientist. And now if I put in eight steps away from the bar, what do you predict he’s going to do? Is he going to go four steps forward and move his paw up and down? Is that the behavior that has been associated with the stimulus? Or would you predict that he’ll go eight steps forward and press down on the bar. That is, the right description is that he’ll go from where he is to the bar and press on the bar? Well, the minute you think about this, you realize that we can gerrymander, what he was taught, there are many descriptions, that that are available to us for what he was taught. And in fact, no one who works with the animals would expect him to move four steps forward, and not be pressing on the bar. But why is that? Is that something that you without importing any understanding of this are objectively reading off of the situation? Or have you, in fact, all along been importing, your characterization of what the regularity is that you are, that you’re characterizing? This is actually empirical as well a methodological problem. What is the prediction that you’re supposed to make at this point? And how do you justify the one rather than rather than the other by your methodological lights?</p></div></details><details id="docphilphilsituationsmontaignedog.htmlmontaigne-dog" open="open" xmlns="">

As all of the considerations that lead people to think have direct stimulus response connections, are satisfied still, if you allow intervening states. It’s still an empirical undertaking, and so on. But there’s a lot more formal power, you can get Turing machines, if you can get functional states, so you can get a lot farther. That’s why nobody should be a classical behaviorist anymore: be a functionalist, you get all the advantages, and a lot more expressive power.<a class="footnote-back" href="#fnref1" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
