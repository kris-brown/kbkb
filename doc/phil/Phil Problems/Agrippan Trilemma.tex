There are only three ways of completing a proof:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The \emph{circular} argument, in which the proof of some proposition presupposes the truth of that very proposition
    \item The \emph{regressive} argument, in which each proof requires a further proof, ad infinitum
    \item The \emph{dogmatic} argument, which rests on accepted precepts which are merely asserted rather than defended
\end{itemize}

This is a dilemma for classical logic in particular; it could be addressed by introducing nonmonotonic logic (default and challenge). Some claims (e.g. first person observations) come with a default justification (which is not based on the justification of other claims). Yet it must be defended when challenged.
