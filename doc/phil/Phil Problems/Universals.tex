It seems there is no problem thinking about what triangles and white things are, but what of triangularity and whiteness?

My thoughts: This seems to be an instance of the \href{doc/phil/PhilSituations/ToothPain}{tooth pain} issue. Noun-ness was for ordinary objects (with obvious ontological status) in an earlier game, but our creativity with language led us to nounify many other words, leading to `objects' with unclear ontological status.
