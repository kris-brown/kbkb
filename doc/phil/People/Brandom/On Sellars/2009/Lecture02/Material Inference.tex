% TAG Def

Descriptive terms appear vacuously when in logically valid inferences and essentially when in \emph{material inferences}. You can turn a good material inference into a bad one by substituting some nonlogical vocabulary for different nonlogical vocabulary, but you cannot turn a logically valid inference into a bad one by the same means. Example: $P \land Q \implies P$ goes through regardless of what we substitute for $P$ and $Q$, but the material inference ``$a$ is red'' $\implies$ ``$a$ is colored'' will become false if we replace `colored' with `square'.
