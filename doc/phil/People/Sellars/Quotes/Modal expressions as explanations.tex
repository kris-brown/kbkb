``To make firsthand use of modal expressions / subjunctive conditionals, is to
be about the business of explaining a state of affairs or justifying an
assertion." \cite{sellars1958counterfactuals}

Note we explain an (actual) state of affairs. We justify an assertion
(non-actual, in the space of reasons).
