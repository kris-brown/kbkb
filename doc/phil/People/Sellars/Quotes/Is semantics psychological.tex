``The means of semantical statements is no more a psychological word than is
the ought of ethical statements or the must of modal statements."

I think of this in the following way: the $\square$ operator can be applied to
statements to make them `modal' (which could be alethic, deontic, or many other
things like ``Jones thinks that ..."). One such $\square$ is ``Semantically,
...'' (or, ``Literally, ...''). Ordinary statements made in practical life
 could be interpreted as having an implicit ``Pragmatically, ...'' (in fact,
 could we define \emph{pragmatics} to be that which play this role?)
