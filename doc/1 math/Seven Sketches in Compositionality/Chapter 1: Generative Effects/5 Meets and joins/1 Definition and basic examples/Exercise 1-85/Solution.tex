\begin{enumerate}
    \item \begin{itemize}
            \item The first condition of the \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 1: Generative Effects/5 Meets and joins/1 Definition and basic examples/Meet and join}{meet} gives us that \,$\wedge A \leq p$\,.
            \item The second condition is that $\forall q \in P: q \leq p \implies q \leq \wedge A$.
                  \begin{itemize}
                    \item Substituting \,$p$\, in for $q$, the antecedent holds such that we get \,$p \leq \wedge A$\,.
                  \end{itemize}
            \item Therefore $p \cong \wedge A$
          \end{itemize}
    \item The difference between a partial order and a preorder is that \,congruent elements are equal\,, so we directly get that $p = \wedge A$
    \item \,Yes, the argument is perfectly symmetric.\,
