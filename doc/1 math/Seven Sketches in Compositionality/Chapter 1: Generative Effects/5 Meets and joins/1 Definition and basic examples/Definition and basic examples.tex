\begin{itemize}
    \item There could be multiple meets/joins, but the definition forces them to be \hyperref[D1.75]{isomorphic}.
    \item An arbitrary preorder need not have a meet nor join.
          \begin{itemize}
            \item E.g a two element discrete preorder has no overall meet/join, because the meet must be less/greater than or equal to both elements in the set.
