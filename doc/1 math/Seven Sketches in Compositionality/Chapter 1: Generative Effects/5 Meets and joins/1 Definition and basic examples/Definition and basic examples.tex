\begin{itemize}
    \item There could be multiple meets/joins, but the definition forces them to be \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 1: Generative Effects/4 Monotone maps/3 Preorder isomorphism}{isomorphic}.
    \item An arbitrary preorder need not have a meet nor join.
          \begin{itemize}
            \item E.g a two element discrete preorder has no overall meet/join, because the meet must be less/greater than or equal to both elements in the set.
