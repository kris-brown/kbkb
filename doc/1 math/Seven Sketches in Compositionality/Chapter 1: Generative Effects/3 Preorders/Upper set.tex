An \emph{upper set} in $P$ for some \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/1 Chapter 1: Generative Effects/3 Preorders/Preorder}{preorder} $(P, \leq)$

\begin{itemize}
    \item A subset $U$ of $P$ satisfying the condition $p \in U \land p \leq q \implies q \in U$
    \item Anything you add to the upper set means you have to add everything greater than it.
    \item Example: the possible upper sets of $Bool$ are $\{\varnothing, \{true\}, \{true, false\}\}$
  \end{itemize}
