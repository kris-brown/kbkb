A \emph{graph} (of vertices, arrows)

\begin{itemize}
    \item A tuple $G=(V, A, s, t)$
    \item Set of vertices and arrows, with two functions $A\rightarrow V$ which say where the source and target of each arrow goes to.
    \item A \emph{path} in $G$ is any sequence of arrows such that the target of one arrow is the source of the next (including length 0 and 1 sequences).
  \end{itemize}
