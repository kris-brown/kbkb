A \emph{preorder} / \emph{partial order} / \emph{total order} \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/1 Chapter 1: Generative Effects/2 What is order/Relation}{relation} on a set $X$

\begin{itemize}
    \item Preorder: a binary relation on $X$ that is reflexive and transitive.
    \item A partial order (poset) has the additional constraint that $x \leq y \land y \leq x \implies x=y$
          \begin{itemize}\item We can always get a partial order from a preorder by \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/1 Chapter 1: Generative Effects/2 What is order/Quotient}{quotienting}, so it's not that special.\end{itemize}
    \item A total order has all elements comparable.
  \end{itemize}
