Suppose $A$ is a \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/1 Chapter 1: Generative Effects/2 What is order/Partition}{partitioned set} and $P,Q$ are two \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/1 Chapter 1: Generative Effects/2 What is order/Partition}{partitions} such that for each $p \in P$ there exists a $q \in Q$ with $A_p=A_q$
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Show that for each $p \in P$ there is at most one $q \in Q$ such that $A_p = A_q$
      \item Show that for each $q \in Q$ there is a $p \in P$ such that $A_p = A_q$
    \end{enumerate}
