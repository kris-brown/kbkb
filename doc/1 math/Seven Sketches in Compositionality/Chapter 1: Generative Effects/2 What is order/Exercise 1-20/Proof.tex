\begin{enumerate}
    \item Part of the definition of \,$\sim$-connected\, is being nonempty
    \item Suppose $a \in A$ is in the intersection. Then \,$a \sim p$ and $a \sim q$ for some elements $p \not\sim q$ arbitrarily selected from $A_p, A_q$\,. But this is impossible because $\sim$ is transitive, so this must be impossible.
    \item \begin{itemize}
            \item Every $a \in A$ is part of some equivalence class which is a $\sim$-closed and $\sim$-connected set, so \,$A \subseteq \bigcup_{p \in P} A_p$\,
                  \begin{itemize}
                    \item The equivalence class is $\sim$-closed because \,two elements being $\sim$-related implies they are in the same equivalence class\,.
                    \item The equivalence class is $\sim$-connected because \,equivalence classes are nonempty and the equivalence relation is transitive\,.
                  \end{itemize}
            \item The constituents of $A_p$ were defined to be subsets of $A$, so unioning these will also be a subset of $A$, i.e. \,$\bigcup_{p \in P} A_p \subseteq A$\,.
            \item Therefore $A = \bigcup_{p \in P} A_p$.
          \end{itemize}
