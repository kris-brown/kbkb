\begin{itemize}
    \item Let $P \overset{f}{\underset{g}{\rightleftarrows}} Q$ be \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 1: Generative Effects/4 Monotone maps/1 Monotone map}{monotone maps} with $f \dashv g$.
    \item Right adjoints preserve \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 1: Generative Effects/5 Meets and joins/1 Definition and basic examples/Meet and join}{meets}
          \begin{itemize}
            \item Suppose $A \subseteq Q$ is any subset and $g(A)$ is its image.
            \item Then, if $A$ has a \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 1: Generative Effects/5 Meets and joins/1 Definition and basic examples/Meet and join}{meet} $\wedge A \in Q$, then $g(A)$ has a \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 1: Generative Effects/5 Meets and joins/1 Definition and basic examples/Meet and join}{meet} $\wedge g(A) \in P$
            \item And $g(\wedge A) \cong \wedge g(A)$

          \begin{itemize}
            \item Given $A \subseteq P$ and its image $f(A) \subseteq Q$
            \item Then, if $A$ has a \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 1: Generative Effects/5 Meets and joins/1 Definition and basic examples/Meet and join}{join} $\vee A \in P$, then $\vee f(a) \in Q$ exists
            \item And $f(\vee A) \cong \vee f(A)$     \end{itemize}
