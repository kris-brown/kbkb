    \item If we replace the $\leq$ in \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 1: Generative Effects/6 Galois connections/3 Basic theory of Galois connections/1 Galois connection alternate form}{Proposition 1.107} with $=$, then we obtain the notion of a \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 1: Generative Effects/4 Monotone maps/3 Preorder isomorphism}{preorder isomorphism}.
    \item Since \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 1: Generative Effects/6 Galois connections/1 Definition and examples/Galois connection}{left adjoints} preserve \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 1: Generative Effects/5 Meets and joins/1 Definition and basic examples/Meet and join}{joins}, we know a \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 1: Generative Effects/4 Monotone maps/1 Monotone map}{monotone map} cannot have \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 1: Generative Effects/5 Meets and joins/2 Back to observations and generative effects/2 Generative effect}{generative effects} iff it is left adjoint to some other \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 1: Generative Effects/4 Monotone maps/1 Monotone map}{monotone}.
