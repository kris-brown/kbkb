Show that if $P \xrightarrow{f}Q$ has a \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 1: Generative Effects/6 Galois connections/1 Definition and examples/Galois connection}{right adjoint} \emph{g}, then it is unique up to \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 1: Generative Effects/4 Monotone maps/3 Preorder isomorphism}{isomorphism}.  Is the same true for \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 1: Generative Effects/6 Galois connections/1 Definition and examples/Galois connection}{left adjoints}?
