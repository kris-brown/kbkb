\begin{itemize}
    \item Let $A \xrightarrow{f} B$ be a set function, say between apples and buckets into which we put each apple.
    \item The `\href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 1: Generative Effects/4 Monotone maps/4 Pullback along monotone}{pullback} along \emph{f}' $\mathbb{P}(B) \xrightarrow{f^*} \mathbb{P}(A)$ maps each subset $B' \subseteq B$ to its preimage $f^{-1}(B') \subseteq A$
          \begin{itemize}
            \item It tells you \,for a set of buckets all the apples contained in total\,.
            \item It is a \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 1: Generative Effects/4 Monotone maps/1 Monotone map}{monotonic} map which has a left and right adjoint: $f_! \dashv f^* \dashv f_*$
          \end{itemize}
    \item The \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 1: Generative Effects/6 Galois connections/1 Definition and examples/Galois connection}{left adjoint} $\mathbb{P}(A)\xrightarrow{f_!}\mathbb{P}(B)$ is given by the direct image
          \begin{itemize}
            \item $f_!(A') := \{b \in B\ |\ \exists a \in A': f(a)=b\}$
            \item Tells you \,for a set of apples all the buckets that contain at least one of those apples\,.
          \end{itemize}
    \item The \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 1: Generative Effects/6 Galois connections/1 Definition and examples/Galois connection}{right adjoint} $\mathbb{P}(A) \xrightarrow{f_*} \mathbb{P}(B)$ is defined as follows:
          \begin{itemize}
            \item  $f_*(A') := \{b \in B\ |\ \forall a: f(a)=b \implies a \in A'\}$
            \item Tells you \,all the buckets which are all-$A\prime$ (note that empty buckets vacuously satisfy this condition)\,.
          \end{itemize}
    \item Adjoints often turn out to have interesting semantic interpretations.
