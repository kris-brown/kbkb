\begin{itemize}
    \item Adjoint functor theorem for \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 1: Generative Effects/3 Preorders/1 Preorder}{preorders}
    \item Suppose $Q$ is a preorder that has all \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 1: Generative Effects/5 Meets and joins/1 Definition and basic examples/Meet and join}{meets} and $P$ is any preorder.
          \begin{itemize}
            \item A \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 1: Generative Effects/4 Monotone maps/1 Monotone map}{monotone map} $Q \xrightarrow{g} P$ preserves \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 1: Generative Effects/5 Meets and joins/1 Definition and basic examples/Meet and join}{meets} iff it is a \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 1: Generative Effects/6 Galois connections/1 Definition and examples/Galois connection}{right adjoint}.
          \end{itemize}
    \item Likewise, suppose $P$ has all joins and $Q$ is any preorder:
          \begin{itemize}
            \item A \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 1: Generative Effects/4 Monotone maps/1 Monotone map}{monotone map} $P \xrightarrow{f} Q$ preserves \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 1: Generative Effects/5 Meets and joins/1 Definition and basic examples/Meet and join}{joins} iff it is a \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 1: Generative Effects/6 Galois connections/1 Definition and examples/Galois connection}{left adjoint}.\end{itemize}
    \item Proved the reverse direction in \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 1: Generative Effects/5 Meets and joins/1 Definition and basic examples/Meets of subsets}{Proposition 1.91}.
