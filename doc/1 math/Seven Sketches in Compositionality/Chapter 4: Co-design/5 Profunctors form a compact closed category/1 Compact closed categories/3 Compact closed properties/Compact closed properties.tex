If $\mathcal{C}$ is a \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 4: Co-design/5 Profunctors form a compact closed category/1 Compact closed categories/2 Compact closed SMC}{compact closed category}, then:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item $\mathcal{C}$ is \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 2: Resource theories/5 Computing presented V-categories with matrix mult/1 Monoidal closed preorders/0 Monoidal closed preorders}{monoidal closed}
      \item the \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 4: Co-design/5 Profunctors form a compact closed category/1 Compact closed categories/1 Dual object in a SMC}{dual} of \emph{c} is unique up to isomorphism
      \item $c \cong (c^*)^*$
