    \item A \emph{correlation} $A \rightarrow B$ is an equivalence relation on $A \sqcup B$
    \item Correlations are composed by the following rule: two elements are equivalent in the composite if we may travel from one to the other while staying within the component equivalence classes of either
    \item There is a symmetric monoidal structure $(\varnothing, \sqcup)$. For any finite set \emph{A} there is an equivalence relation on $A \sqcup A$ that partitions elements in the first set from the second. The unit and counit are given by this partition:
          \begin{itemize}
            \item $\varnothing \xrightarrow{\eta_A} A \sqcup A$
            \item $A \sqcup A \xrightarrow{\epsilon_A} \varnothing$
          \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
