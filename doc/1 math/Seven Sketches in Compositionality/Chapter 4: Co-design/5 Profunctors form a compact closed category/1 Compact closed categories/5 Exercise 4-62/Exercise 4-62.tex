\begin{enumerate}
    \item Draw a picture of the unit correlation $\varnothing \xrightarrow{\eta_{\bar 3}} \bar 3 \sqcup \bar 3$
    \item Draw a picture of the counit correlation $\bar 3 \sqcup \bar 3 \xrightarrow{\epsilon_{\bar 3}} \varnothing$
    \item Check that the \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 4: Co-design/5 Profunctors form a compact closed category/1 Compact closed categories/1 Dual object in a SMC}{snake equations} hold. Since every object is its own dual, only one has to be checked.
  \end{enumerate}
