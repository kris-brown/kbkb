\begin{itemize}
    \item  Whenever you have 10 W of power, you also have 5 W ($5 W \leq 10 W$)
    \item The requirement that the \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 4: Co-design/2 Enriched profunctors/1 Feasibility relationships as Bool-profunctors/1 Feasilibiliy relation}{feasibility relation map} is \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 1: Generative Effects/4 Monotone maps/1 Monotone map}{monotone} says that if $x' \leq_X x$ and $y \leq_Y y'$, then $\phi(x,y) \leq_{Bool} \phi(x',y')$
          \begin{itemize}
            \item If \emph{x} can be obtained from \emph{y}, something easier to obtain than \emph{x} can also be obtained from \emph{y}
            \item If \emph{x} can be obtained from \emph{y}, then \emph{x} can be obtained from something harder to obtain than \emph{y}
          \end{itemize}
    \item This chapter should make the following table clear:
  \begin{minipage}{0.48\textwidth}

    \begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
      \hline
      \textbf{Bool}-\href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 2: Resource theories/3 Enrichment/1 V-categories/1 V-category}{category}  & \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 1: Generative Effects/3 Preorders/1 Preorder}{preorder}            \\ \hline
      \textbf{Bool}-\href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 2: Resource theories/4 Constructions on V-categories/2 Enriched functors/1 V-functor}{functor}   & \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 1: Generative Effects/4 Monotone maps/1 Monotone map}{monotone map}        \\ \hline

  \item \textbf{Bool} is a \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 2: Resource theories/5 Computing presented V-categories with matrix mult/2 Quantales/1 Quantale}{quantale}, meaning it \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 2: Resource theories/5 Computing presented V-categories with matrix mult/2 Quantales/4 Quantale is SMP with all joins}{has all joins} and a closure operation, $\mathbb{B}\times\mathbb{B}\xrightarrow{\Rightarrow}\mathbb{B}$. The closure operation must satisfy $b \land c \leq d$ iff $b \leq (c \Rightarrow d)$. It is the fact that \textbf{Bool} is a quantale that makes this chapter work; we could alternatively use \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 2: Resource theories/2 Symmetric monoidal preorders/4 Abstract examples/4 Cost SMP}{Cost} and obtain the \emph{cost} of obtaining $x$ from $y$, not just whether or not it's possible.
