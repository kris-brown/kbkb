\begin{itemize}
    \item General idea: take a thing we know and add structure to it such that things that were formerly \emph{properties} become \emph{structures}
    \item Do in such a way as to be able to recover the thing we categorified by forgetting the new structure.
    \item In categorified world, we have more structure available to talk about the relationships between objects.
    \item An example is how we treated preorders as categories.
    \item Ordinary categories are \textbf{Set}-categories
  \end{itemize}
