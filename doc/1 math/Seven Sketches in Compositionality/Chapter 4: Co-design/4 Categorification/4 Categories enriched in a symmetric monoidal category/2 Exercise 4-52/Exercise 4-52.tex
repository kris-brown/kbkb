Recall the \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 4: Co-design/4 Categorification/3 Monoidal categories/2 Set as SMC}{example} with \textbf{Set} as a symmetric moniodal category. Apply the definition of a $\mathcal{V}$ \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 4: Co-design/4 Categorification/4 Categories enriched in a symmetric monoidal category/1 Enrichment in a SMC}{category} and see if this agrees with the definition of an ordinary \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 3: Databases/2 Categories/1 Free Categories/1 Category}{category}. Is there a subtle difference?
