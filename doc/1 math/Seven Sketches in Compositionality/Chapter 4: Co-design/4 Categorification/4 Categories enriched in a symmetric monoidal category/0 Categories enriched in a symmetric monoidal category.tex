\begin{itemize}
    \item We said that ordinary categories were just \textbf{Set}-categories, but our definition of $\mathcal{V}$ categories required the $\mathcal{V}$ to be a preorder!
    \item We have to generalize (categorify) $\mathcal{V}$ categories.
    \item Symmetric monoidal preorders can be considered as symmetric monoidal categories, despite not providing the data for identities and composition (these are not needed because there is no choice).

            \item Example of property becoming structure: $I \leq \mathcal{X}(x,x)$ is a property of $\mathcal{V}$ \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 2: Resource theories/3 Enrichment/1 V-categories/1 V-category}{categories as defined earlier} but become part of the structure in the \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 4: Co-design/4 Categorification/4 Categories enriched in a symmetric monoidal category/1 Enrichment in a SMC}{categorified version of the definition}.
