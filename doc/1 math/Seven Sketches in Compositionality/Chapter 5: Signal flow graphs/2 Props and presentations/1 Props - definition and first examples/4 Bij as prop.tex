    \item Recall that a \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 1: Generative Effects/2 What is order/Function}{bijection} is both surjective and injective.
    \item There is a \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 5: Signal flow graphs/2 Props and presentations/1 Props - definition and first examples/1 Prop}{prop} \textbf{Bij} where morphisms are bijections
    \item $m\ne n \implies$ \,$\mathbf{Bij}(m,n)=\varnothing)$\,
    \item \textbf{Bij} is a \,subcategory\, of \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 5: Signal flow graphs/2 Props and presentations/1 Props - definition and first examples/3 FinSet as prop}{\textbf{FinSet}}, so we can use the same monoidal product.
