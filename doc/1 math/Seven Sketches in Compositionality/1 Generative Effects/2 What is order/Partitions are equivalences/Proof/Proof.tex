\begin{itemize}
    \item Every \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/1 Generative Effects/2 What is order/Partition}{partition} gives rise to a distinct equivalence relation
          \begin{itemize} \item Define $a \sim b$ to mean \,$a,b$ are in the same part\,. This is a \,reflective, symmetric, and transitive\, relation given the definition of a partition.\end{itemize}
    \item Every equivalence relation gives rise to a distinct partition.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Define a subset $X \subseteq A$ as $\sim$-closed if, for every $x \in X$ and $x' \sim x$, we have $x' \in X$.
    \item Define a subset $X \subseteq A$ as $\sim$-connected if it is nonempty and $\forall x,y \in X:\ x \sim y$
    \item The parts corresponding to $\sim$ are precisely the $\sim$-closed and $\sim$-connected subsets.
  \end{itemize}
