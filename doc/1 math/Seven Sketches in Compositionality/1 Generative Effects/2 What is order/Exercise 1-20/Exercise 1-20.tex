Finish proof \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/1 Generative Effects/2 What is order/Partitions are equivalences}{Proposition 1.19}. Suppose that $\sim$ is an equivalence relation on a set A, and let P be the set of $\sim$-closed and $\sim$-connected subsets.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Show that each part $A_p$ is nonempty
  \item Show that $p \ne q \implies A_p \cap A_q = \varnothing$
  \item Show that $A = \bigcup_{p \in P} A_p$
\end{enumerate}
