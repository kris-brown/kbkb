  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Suppose $q' \ne q$. If they are both equal to $A_p$ then they are equal to each other, but a partition rule is that $q' \ne q$ must have an empty intersection (and $A_p$ cannot be empty by the other rule).
    \item By part 1, the mapping between part labels is a bijection, so there is an inverse map as well.
  \end{enumerate}
