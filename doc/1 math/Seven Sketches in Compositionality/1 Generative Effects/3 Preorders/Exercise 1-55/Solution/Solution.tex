\begin{itemize}
    \item The upper set criterion is satisfied by any subset, thus all possible subsets are upper sets.
    \item The \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/1 Generative Effects/2 What is order/Relation}{binary relation} is equality, thus the upper subset criterion becomes $p \in U \land p = q \implies q \in U$ or alternatively $p \in U \implies p \in U$ which is always satisfied.
  \end{itemize}
