\begin{itemize}
    \item $V=\{v,w\}, A=\varnothing$
    \item The second condition of the set comprehension is vacuously satisfied because $A = \varnothing$
    \item So all we have left is all pairs of tuples where the first element comes from $D(v)$ and the second element comes from the set $D(w)$.
    \item This is the Cartesian product $D(v) \times D(w)$
  \end{itemize}
