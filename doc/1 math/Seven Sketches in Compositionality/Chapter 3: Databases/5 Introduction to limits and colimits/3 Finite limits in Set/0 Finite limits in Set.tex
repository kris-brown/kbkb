\begin{itemize}
    \item This section shows that a database instance $\mathcal{J}\xrightarrow{I}\mathbf{Set}$ is a \hyperref[D3.51]{diagram} in \textbf{Set}. Also the functor $\Pi_!$ takes the \hyperref[D3.92b]{limit} of this diagram.
    \item Details not presented, but it suffices to work with just the finitely-presented graph of $\mathcal{J}$ rather than the \hyperref[D3.6]{category} itself (path equations not relevant for this).
  \end{itemize}
