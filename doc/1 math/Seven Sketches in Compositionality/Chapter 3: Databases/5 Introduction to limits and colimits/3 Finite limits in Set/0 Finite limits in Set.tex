\begin{itemize}
    \item This section shows that a database instance $\mathcal{J}\xrightarrow{I}\mathbf{Set}$ is a \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 3: Databases/5 Introduction to limits and colimits/2 Limits/4 Cone}{diagram} in \textbf{Set}. Also the functor $\Pi_!$ takes the \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 3: Databases/5 Introduction to limits and colimits/2 Limits/5 Limit}{limit} of this diagram.
    \item Details not presented, but it suffices to work with just the finitely-presented graph of $\mathcal{J}$ rather than the \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 3: Databases/2 Categories/1 Free Categories/1 Category}{category} itself (path equations not relevant for this).
  \end{itemize}
