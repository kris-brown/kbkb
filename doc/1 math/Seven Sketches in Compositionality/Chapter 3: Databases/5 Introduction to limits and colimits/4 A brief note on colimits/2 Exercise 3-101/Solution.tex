\begin{itemize}
    \item  There is an \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 3: Databases/2 Categories/5 Isomorphisms in a category/1 Isomorphism}{isomorphism} between a \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 3: Databases/2 Categories/1 Free Categories/1 Category}{category} and its opposite, meaning there are natural functors $\overset{\cong}\rightarrow$ which alternate between them.
    \item Define $\mathcal{C}^{op}\xrightarrow{F^{op}}\mathcal{D}^{op}$ as $F ; \overset{\cong}\rightarrow$. This is a valid functor as it is the composition of two functors.
  \end{itemize}
