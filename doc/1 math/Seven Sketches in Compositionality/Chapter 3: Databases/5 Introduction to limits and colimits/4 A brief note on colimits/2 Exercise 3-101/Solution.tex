\begin{itemize}
    \item  There is an \hyperref[D3.28]{isomorphism} between a \hyperref[D3.6]{category} and its opposite, meaning there are natural functors $\overset{\cong}\rightarrow$ which alternate between them.
    \item Define $\mathcal{C}^{op}\xrightarrow{F^{op}}\mathcal{D}^{op}$ as $F ; \overset{\cong}\rightarrow$. This is a valid functor as it is the composition of two functors.
  \end{itemize}
