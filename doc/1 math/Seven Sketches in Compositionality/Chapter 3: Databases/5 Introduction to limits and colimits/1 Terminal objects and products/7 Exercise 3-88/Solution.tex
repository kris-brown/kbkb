\begin{itemize}
    \item  The uniqueness aspect of the product is not relevant since all morphisms are unique in a preorder category.
    \item The product definition translates to an operation which takes a pair of objects in a preorder and gives us another object with the property that $x \times y \leq x$ and $x \times y \leq y$, and for any other \emph{b} that also has this property we have $b \leq x\times y$
    \item Considering the set $A=\{x,y\}$, the conditions for $x \times y$ matches the definition of $\bigwedge A$ (grestest lower bound).
  \end{itemize}
