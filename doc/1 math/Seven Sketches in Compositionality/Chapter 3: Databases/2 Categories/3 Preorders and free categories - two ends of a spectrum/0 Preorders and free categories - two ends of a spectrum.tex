\begin{itemize}
    \item Takeaway: A preorder is a category where every two parallel arrows are the same.
    \item Any preorder can be considered a category, and any category can be crushed down into a preorder (called \emph{preorder reflection}).
          \begin{itemize}
            \item The objects are the elements of the set, and there is a single morphism between \emph{a} and \emph{b} iff $a \leq b$
          \end{itemize}
    \item Considering a preorder as a category is right adjoint to turning a category into a preorder by preorder reflection.
    \item Every category presentation lies somewhere between the free category and the preorder reflection.
  \end{itemize}
