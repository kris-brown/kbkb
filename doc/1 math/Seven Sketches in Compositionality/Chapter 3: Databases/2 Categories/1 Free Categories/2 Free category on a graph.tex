The \hyperref[D3.6]{category} $\mathbf{Free}(G)$, given a \hyperref[D1.36]{graph} $G=(V,A,s,t)$

\begin{itemize}
    \item  A category whose objects are vertices and morphisms are paths.
    \item The identity morphism is the trivial path at any vertex.
    \item Composition is path concatenation (this obeys unitality and associativity)
  \end{itemize}
