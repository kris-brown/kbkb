A \emph{category}, $\mathcal{C}$

\begin{itemize}
    \item Need to specify a collection of objects, $Ob(\mathcal{C})$
    \item For every two objects \emph{c} and \emph{d}, one specifies a set $\mathcal{C}(c,d)$ called \emph{morphisms} from \emph{c} to \emph{d}
          \begin{itemize}
            \item This set is called the \emph{hom-set} and \emph{morphism} is a shorthand for \emph{homomorphism}
          \end{itemize}
    \item For every object \emph{c} one specifies a morphism $id_c \in \mathcal{C}(c,c)$ called the \emph{identity morphism}
    \item For every pair of morphisms $c \xrightarrow{f} d$ and $d \xrightarrow{g} e$, one specifies a morphism $c \xrightarrow{f;g}e$ called the \emph{composite} of \emph{f} and \emph{g}
    \item Furthermore, these must satisfy two conditions:
          \begin{enumerate}
            \item unitality: composing with identities does not change anything
            \item associativity: $(f;g);h = f;(g;h)$
          \end{enumerate}
  \end{itemize}
