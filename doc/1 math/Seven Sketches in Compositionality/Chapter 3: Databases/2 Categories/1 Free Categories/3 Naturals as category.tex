\begin{itemize}
    \item The natural numbers as a \hyperref[D3.7]{free category}: $\boxed{\overset{\bullet}{z}\circlearrowleft s}$
    \item There are \,infinitely\, many paths, in bijection with \,the natural numbers\,.
    \item This is a \hyperref[D3.6]{category} with one object, also called a \emph{monoid}.
    \item The composition operation corresponds to \,the addition operation\,.
    \item Unitality and associativity give us the usual constraints on a monoid.
