\begin{itemize}
    \item The natural numbers as a \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 3: Databases/2 Categories/1 Free Categories/2 Free category on a graph}{free category}: $\boxed{\overset{\bullet}{z}\circlearrowleft s}$
    \item There are \,infinitely\, many paths, in bijection with \,the natural numbers\,.
    \item This is a \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 3: Databases/2 Categories/1 Free Categories/1 Category}{category} with one object, also called a \emph{monoid}.
    \item The composition operation corresponds to \,the addition operation\,.
    \item Unitality and associativity give us the usual constraints on a monoid.
