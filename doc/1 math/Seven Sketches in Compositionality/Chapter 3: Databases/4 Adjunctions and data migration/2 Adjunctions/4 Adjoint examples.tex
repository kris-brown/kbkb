Examples of adjunctions
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Free constructions: given a set you get a free group\emph{monoid}ring/vector space/etc. - each of these is a \,left\, adjoint. The corresponding \,right\, adjoint throws away the algebraic structure.
  \item Given a graph you get a free \hyperref[D1.30]{preorder} or a free category, the corresponding right adjoint is the underlying graph of a preorder/category.
  \item Discrete things: given any set you get a discrete preorder\emph{graph}metric space\emph{category}topological space/etc.; each of these is a \,left\, adjoint and the corresponding \,right\, adjoint again recovers the set.
  \item Codiscrete things: given any set you get a codiscrete preorder, complete graph, codiscrete category, category, etc.; each of these is a \,right adjoint\, and the \,left\, adjoint gives the underlying set.
  \item Given a group, you can quotient by its commutator subgroup to get an abelian group; this is a \,left\, adjoint. The \,right\, adjoint is the inclusion of abelian groups into \textbf{Grp}
