\begin{itemize}
    \item Consider a functor which discards the distinction between Economy and First Class seats in an airplane.
    \item $\begin{tikzcd} & Money & \\ Econ \arrow[ru, "Price"] \arrow[rd, "Position"'] & & 1st \arrow[lu, "Price"'] \arrow[ld, "Position"] \\ & string & \end{tikzcd}$
    \item $\begin{tikzcd} Money \\ Seat \arrow[u, "Price"] \arrow[d, "Position"'] \\ string \end{tikzcd}$
    \item The $\Delta$ functor is uninteresting - it will \,copy the rows for Seat into both Economy and First class\,.
    \item The functor $\Pi$ puts into each airline seat \,only seats which are in both the Economy and First Class tables with the same price and position\,.
    \item The functor $\Sigma$ puts \,all Economy and First Class seats into the Seat table\, and discards \,the information of from which table they came from\,.
  \end{itemize}
