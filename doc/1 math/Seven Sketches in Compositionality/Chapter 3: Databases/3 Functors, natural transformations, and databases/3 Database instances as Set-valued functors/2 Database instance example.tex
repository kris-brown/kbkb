\begin{itemize}
    \item Consider the following category: $\boxed{\overset{\bullet}{z}\circlearrowleft s\ \ \boxed{s;s = s}}$
    \item A \hyperref[D3.35]{functor} from this category to \textbf{Set} is \,a set $Z$\, and \,a involution function $Z \rightarrow Z$\,.
          \begin{itemize}
            \item $Z =$ natural numbers and a function sending everything to zero (zero is sent to zero)
            \item $Z =$ set of well-formed arithmetic expressions (e.g. $12+(2*4)$) and a function which evaluates to an integer (which itself is a well-formed expression). Evaluation on integers does nothing.
            \item A function which sends numbers greater than 2 to their smallest prime factor (this is a no-op on the prime factors themselves).
          \end{itemize}
