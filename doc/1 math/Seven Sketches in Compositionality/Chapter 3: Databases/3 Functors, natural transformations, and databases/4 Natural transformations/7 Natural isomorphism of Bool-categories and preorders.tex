\begin{itemize}
    \item  There exists a category \textbf{PrO} which has \,preorders\, as objects and \,\href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 1: Generative Effects/4 Monotone maps/1 Monotone map}{monotone maps}\, as morphisms.
    \item There exists a category *Bool-Cat* in which the objects are \,\textbf{Bool}-categories\, and morphisms are \,\textbf{Bool}-\href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 2: Resource theories/4 Constructions on V-categories/2 Enriched functors/1 V-functor}{functors}\,.
    \item We call these categories equivalent because there exist \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 3: Databases/3 Functors, natural transformations, and databases/2 Functors/1 Functor}{functors} $\mathbf{PrO}\overset{F}{\underset{G}{\rightleftarrows}}\mathbf{BoolCat}$ such that there exist \,\href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 3: Databases/3 Functors, natural transformations, and databases/4 Natural transformations/1 Natural transformation}{natural isomorphisms}\, $F;G \cong id_\mathbf{PrO}$ and $G;F \cong id_\mathbf{Bool-Cat}$
