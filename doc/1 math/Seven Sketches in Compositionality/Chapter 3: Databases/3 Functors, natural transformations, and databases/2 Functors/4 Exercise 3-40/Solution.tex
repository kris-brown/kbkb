Let the two \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 3: Databases/3 Functors, natural transformations, and databases/2 Functors/1 Functor}{functors} map the left object to the left object and right object to the right object. The first \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 3: Databases/3 Functors, natural transformations, and databases/2 Functors/1 Functor}{functor} maps the nontrivial morphism to the upper morphism in $\mathcal{D}$, whereas the second maps it to the lower morphism.
