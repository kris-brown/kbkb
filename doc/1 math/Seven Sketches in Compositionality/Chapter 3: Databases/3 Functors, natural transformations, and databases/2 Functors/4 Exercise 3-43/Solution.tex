\begin{enumerate}
    \item  Mapping objects and morphisms to themselves satsifies the \hyperref[D3.35]{functor} constraints of preserving identities and composition.
    \item If $F,G$ both independently preserve identity arrows, then composition of these will also preserve this. Also $G(F(f;g))=G(F(f);F(g))=G(F(f));G(F(g))$ using the independent facts that $F,G$ each preserve composition.
    \item Composition of identity functions do not change anything, so the identity \hyperref[D3.35]{functor} (defined by identity function) will obey unitality. Because function composition is associative and functor composition is defined by this, we also satisfy that constraint.

  \end{enumerate}
