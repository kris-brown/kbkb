\begin{enumerate}
    \item Given a category $\mathcal{C}$, show that there exists a \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 3: Databases/3 Functors, natural transformations, and databases/2 Functors/1 Functor}{functor} $id_\mathcal{C}$ known as the identity \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 3: Databases/3 Functors, natural transformations, and databases/2 Functors/1 Functor}{functor} on $\mathcal{C}$
    \item Show that given $\mathcal{C}\xrightarrow{F}\mathcal{D}$ and $\mathcal{D}\xrightarrow{G}\mathcal{E}$ we can define a new \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 3: Databases/3 Functors, natural transformations, and databases/2 Functors/1 Functor}{functor} $\mathcal{C}\xrightarrow{F;G}\mathcal{E}$ just by composing functions.
    \item Show that there is a category, let's call it \textbf{Cat} where the objects are \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 3: Databases/2 Categories/1 Free Categories/1 Category}{categories}, morphisms are \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 3: Databases/3 Functors, natural transformations, and databases/2 Functors/1 Functor}{functors}, and identities/composition are given as above.
