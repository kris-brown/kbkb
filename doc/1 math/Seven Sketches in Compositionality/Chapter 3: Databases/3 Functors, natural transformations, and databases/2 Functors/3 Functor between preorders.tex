Functors between preorders are \,\href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 1: Generative Effects/4 Monotone maps/1 Monotone map}{monotone maps}\,. Morphisms in the source must map to sources in the target, so if $a \leq_P b$, then we require $F(a) \leq_Q F(b)$, which is tantamount to \,the \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 1: Generative Effects/4 Monotone maps/1 Monotone map}{monotone map} constraint\,.
