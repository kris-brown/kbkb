Consider the graphs $G,H$ from \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 3: Databases/3 Functors, natural transformations, and databases/5 The category of instances on a schema/3 Arrow table}{Example 3.63}. We claim there is exactly one graph homomorphism such that $\alpha_{Arr}(a)=d$. What is the other value of $\alpha_{Arr}$, and what are the three values of $\alpha_{Vert}$?
