Consider the \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 2: Resource theories/2 Symmetric monoidal preorders/1 Definition and first examples/1 Symmetric monoidal structure on a preorder}{symmetric monoidal preorder} $\mathcal{W}:=(\mathbb{N}\cup\{\infty\},\leq,\infty,min)$
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Draw a small graph labeled by elements of $\mathbb{N}\cup\{\infty\}$
      \item Write a the matrix whose rows and columns are indexed by nodes in the graph, whose (x,y)th entry is given by the \emph{maximum} over all paths \emph{p} from \emph{x} to \emph{y} of the \emph{minimum} edge label in \emph{p}.
      \item Prove that this matrix is a matrix of hom-objects for a $\mathcal{W}$ \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 2: Resource theories/3 Enrichment/1 V-categories/1 V-category}{category} called $\mathcal{X}$.
      \item Make up an interpretation for what it means to enrich in $\mathcal{W}$
    \end{enumerate}
