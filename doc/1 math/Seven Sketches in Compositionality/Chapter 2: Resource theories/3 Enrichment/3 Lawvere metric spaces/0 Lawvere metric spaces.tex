\begin{itemize}
    \item Can convert any weighted graph into a \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 2: Resource theories/3 Enrichment/3 Lawvere metric spaces/2 Lawvere metric space}{Lawvere metric space}, where a the distance is the sum of weights along the shortest path.
    \item It can be hard to see the shortest path by inspection, but a matrix power iteration method (starting from just a matrix of edge weights) is possible.
