\begin{itemize}
    \item Imagine the points of a \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 2: Resource theories/3 Enrichment/3 Lawvere metric spaces/1 Metric space}{metric space} are whole regions, like US, Spain, and Boston. Distance is "Given the worst case scenario, how far do you have to travel to get from region \emph{A} to \emph{B}?"
    \item This actually breaks our symmetry requirement: $d(Boston,US)=0, d(US,Boston) > 0$
    \item Which distance is bigger in this framework: $d(Spain,US)$ or $d(US,Spain)$?
  \end{itemize}
