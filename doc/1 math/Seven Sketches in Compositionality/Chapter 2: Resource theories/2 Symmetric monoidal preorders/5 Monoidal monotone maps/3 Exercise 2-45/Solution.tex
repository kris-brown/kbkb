\begin{enumerate}
    \item   Yes. Monotonicity holds, and multiplication by 1 is unital. The operator is symmetric and associative.
    \item Exponentiation (say, by $2$) is a \emph{strict} \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 2: Resource theories/2 Symmetric monoidal preorders/5 Monoidal monotone maps/1 Monoidal monotone}{monoidal monotone}.
          \begin{itemize}
            \item $1 = 2^0$ and $2^x * 2^y = 2^{x+y}$
          \end{itemize}
    \item No: monotonicity does not hold (multiplying negative numbers gives a larger number).
