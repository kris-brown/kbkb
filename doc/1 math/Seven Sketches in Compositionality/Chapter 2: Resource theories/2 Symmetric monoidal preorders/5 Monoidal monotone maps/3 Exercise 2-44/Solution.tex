\begin{itemize}
    \item The function $d$ asks \,``Is it zero?''\,, and the function $u$ asks \,``Is it finite?''\,.
    \item Both of these questions are monotone: \,as we traverse forward in $\leq_{Cost}$, we traverse towards being zero or being finite\,.
    \item The first monoidal monotone axiom is satisifed in both because \,the unit ($0$) is mapped to the unit ($True$)\,.
    \item The second monoidal monotone axiom holds for both because \,addition preserves both things being zero (or not) and both things being finite (or not)\,.
    \item These are strict because, in $Bool$, \,equality and congruence coincide\,.
  \end{itemize}
