    \item Let $[0,\infty]$ represent the non-negative real numbers with infinity. Also take the usual notion of $\geq$.
    \item There is a monoidal structure for this preorder: $\mathbf{Cost}:=([0,\infty],\geq,0,+)$
          \begin{itemize}
            \item The monoidal unit being zero means \,``you can get from \emph{a} to \emph{a} at no cost."\,
            \item The product being + means \,``getting from \emph{a} to \emph{c} is \textbf{at most} the cost of \emph{a} to \emph{b} \textbf{plus} \emph{b} to \emph{c}"\,
            \item The `at most' above comes from the \,$\geq$\,.   \end{itemize}
