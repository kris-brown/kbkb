\begin{itemize}
    \item  Consider the preorder defined by the Hasse diagram $\boxed{no \rightarrow maybe \rightarrow yes}$
    \item Consider a potential \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 2: Resource theories/2 Symmetric monoidal preorders/1 Definition and first examples/1 Symmetric monoidal structure on a preorder}{monoidal structure} with $yes$ as the unit and $min$ as the product.
    \item Fill out a reasonable definition of $min$ and check that it satisfies the \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 2: Resource theories/2 Symmetric monoidal preorders/1 Definition and first examples/1 Symmetric monoidal structure on a preorder}{conditions}.
