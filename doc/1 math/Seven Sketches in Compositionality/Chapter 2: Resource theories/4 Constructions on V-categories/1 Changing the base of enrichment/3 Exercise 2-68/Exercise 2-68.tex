Find a different \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 2: Resource theories/2 Symmetric monoidal preorders/5 Monoidal monotone maps/1 Monoidal monotone}{monoidal monotone map} $\mathbf{Cost}\xrightarrow{g}\mathbf{Bool}$ from the one in \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 2: Resource theories/4 Constructions on V-categories/1 Changing the base of enrichment/2 Metric space to preorder}{Example 2.65}.  Using the construction from \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 2: Resource theories/4 Constructions on V-categories/1 Changing the base of enrichment/1 Induced V-categories from monoidal monotones}{Proposition 2.64}, convert a \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 2: Resource theories/3 Enrichment/3 Lawvere metric spaces/2 Lawvere metric space}{Lawvere metric space} into two different preorders. Find a metric space for which this happens.\textcolor{white}{NOCARD}
