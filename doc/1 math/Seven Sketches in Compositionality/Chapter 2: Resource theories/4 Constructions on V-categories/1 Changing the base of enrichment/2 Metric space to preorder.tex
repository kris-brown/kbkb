\begin{itemize}
    \item Consider the function $[0,\infty] \xrightarrow{f} \mathbb{B}$ which maps 0 to \emph{true} and otherwise to \emph{false}.
    \item Can check that \emph{f} is monotonic and preserves the monoidal product+unit, so it is a \,\href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 2: Resource theories/2 Symmetric monoidal preorders/5 Monoidal monotone maps/1 Monoidal monotone}{monoidal monotone}\,. (this was shown in \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 2: Resource theories/2 Symmetric monoidal preorders/5 Monoidal monotone maps/3 Exercise 2-44}{Exercise 2.44})
    \item Thus we have a tool to convert metric spaces into \,preorders\,.
