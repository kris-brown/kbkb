Recall the ``\href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 2: Resource theories/3 Enrichment/3 Lawvere metric spaces/4 Exercise 2-52}{regions of the world}'' Hausdorff metric space We learned that a \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 2: Resource theories/3 Enrichment/3 Lawvere metric spaces/1 Metric space}{metric space} can be converted into a \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 1: Generative Effects/3 Preorders/1 Preorder}{preorder} by a \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 2: Resource theories/4 Constructions on V-categories/1 Changing the base of enrichment/2 Metric space to preorder}{particular} \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 2: Resource theories/2 Symmetric monoidal preorders/5 Monoidal monotone maps/1 Monoidal monotone}{monoidal monotone map}. How would you interpret the resulting \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 1: Generative Effects/3 Preorders/1 Preorder}{preorder}?
