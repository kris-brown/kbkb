\begin{itemize}
    \item The \hyperref[D1.35]{skeletal} dagger cost \hyperref[D2.46]{category} has a set of objects, $Ob(\mathcal{X})$ which we can call \,points\,.
    \item For any pair of points, we assign a hom-object in $[0,\infty]$ (we can call this a \,distance function\,).
    \item \hyperref[D1.35]{Skeletal} property enforces the constraint \,$d(x,y)=0 \iff x=y$\,.
    \item The second \hyperref[D2.46]{enriched category} property enforces \,the triangle inequality\,.
    \item Because we have a dagger \hyperref[D2.46]{category}, our distance function is \,forced to be symmetric\,.
    \item Just like the information of a preorder is discarded (to yield a set) when we only consider skeletal dagger preorders, information must be discarded from \textbf{Cost}-categories to yield a Lawvere metric space.

  \end{itemize}
