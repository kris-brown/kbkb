A \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 2: Resource theories/3 Enrichment/1 V-categories/1 V-category}{category} $\mathcal{V}$ that is \emph{\href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 2: Resource theories/3 Enrichment/1 V-categories/1 V-category}{enriched} in itself}.

\begin{itemize}
    \item  For every $v,w \in Ob(\mathcal{V})$ we can define $\mathcal{V}(v,w)$ as \,$(v \multimap w) \in \mathcal{V}$\,
    \item For this to be an enrichment, we need to check the \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 2: Resource theories/3 Enrichment/1 V-categories/1 V-category}{two conditions}.
          \begin{itemize}
            \item The first condition \,$I \leq \mathcal{X}(x,x) = x \multimap x$\, is satsified because \,$I \otimes x \leq x$\,
            \item The second condition is satisfied by \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 2: Resource theories/5 Computing presented V-categories with matrix mult/1 Monoidal closed preorders/5 SMP currying}{P2.87e}
