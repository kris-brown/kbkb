\begin{enumerate}
    \item
          \begin{itemize}
            \item Given the \,monotonicity constraint\, of $\otimes$
            \item And \,reflexivity: $v \leq v$\,, we have:
            \item $x_1 \leq y_1$ implies that $(x_1 \otimes v) \leq (y_1 \otimes v)$
          \end{itemize}
    \item Substitute \,$v \multimap w$ for $a$\, into the \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 2: Resource theories/5 Computing presented V-categories with matrix mult/1 Monoidal closed preorders/1 Closed SMP}{closed property equation}, to get \,$((v \multimap w)\otimes v) \leq w \iff v \multimap w \leq v \multimap w$\, (the RHS is true by reflexivity, so the LHS must be true).
    \item Need to show: if we assume \,$x \leq y$\, then we can conclude \,$(v \multimap x) \leq (v \multimap y)$\,
          \begin{itemize}
            \item From the previous part, we have $(v \multimap x) \otimes v \leq x$ and $(v \multimap y) \otimes v \leq y$
            \item Assuming the antecedant \,$x \leq y$\,, and \,given transitivity\,, we have $(v \multimap x) \otimes v \leq (v \multimap y) \otimes v$
            \item Because \,the $\otimes$ operation must be \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 2: Resource theories/2 Symmetric monoidal preorders/1 Definition and first examples/1 Symmetric monoidal structure on a preorder}{monotonic}\,, the consequent follows.
          \end{itemize}
    \item A \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 1: Generative Effects/6 Galois connections/1 Definition and examples/Galois connection}{Galois connection} requires that both maps be \,\href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 1: Generative Effects/4 Monotone maps/1 Monotone map}{monotone}\, and that they satisfy \,$f(p)\leq q$ iff $p \leq g(q)$\,. This is the relation captured by the \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 2: Resource theories/5 Computing presented V-categories with matrix mult/1 Monoidal closed preorders/1 Closed SMP}{closed property equation}, and both maps were shown to be \,\href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 1: Generative Effects/4 Monotone maps/1 Monotone map}{monotone}\,.
