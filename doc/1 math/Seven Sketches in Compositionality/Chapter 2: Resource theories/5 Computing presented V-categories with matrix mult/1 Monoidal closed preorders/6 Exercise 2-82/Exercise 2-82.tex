Prove that a \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 2: Resource theories/2 Symmetric monoidal preorders/1 Definition and first examples/1 Symmetric monoidal structure on a preorder}{symmetric monoidal preorder} is \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 2: Resource theories/5 Computing presented V-categories with matrix mult/1 Monoidal closed preorders/1 Closed SMP}{closed} iff, given any $v \in V$, the map $V \xrightarrow{(-\otimes v)}V$ given by multiply with \emph{v} has a right adjoint.  We write this adjoint $V \xrightarrow{(v \multimap -)}V$:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Show that $V \xrightarrow{(-\otimes v)}V$ is \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 1: Generative Effects/4 Monotone maps/1 Monotone map}{monotone}.
  \item Supposing that $\mathcal{V}$ is \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 2: Resource theories/5 Computing presented V-categories with matrix mult/1 Monoidal closed preorders/1 Closed SMP}{closed}, show that $\forall v,w \in V: ((v \multimap w)\otimes v) \leq w$
  \item Show that $(v \multimap -)$ is \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 1: Generative Effects/4 Monotone maps/1 Monotone map}{monotone}.
  \item Conclude that a \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 2: Resource theories/2 Symmetric monoidal preorders/1 Definition and first examples/1 Symmetric monoidal structure on a preorder}{symmetric monoidal preorder} is \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 2: Resource theories/5 Computing presented V-categories with matrix mult/1 Monoidal closed preorders/1 Closed SMP}{closed} iff the \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 1: Generative Effects/4 Monotone maps/1 Monotone map}{monotone map} $(- \otimes v)$ has a right adjoint.
