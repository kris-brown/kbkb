\begin{itemize}
    \item  \hyperref[D1.81]{Meets and joins} are dual, so it suffices to prove one of the directions (the \hyperref[E2.73]{opposite category} shows that having all \hyperref[D1.81]{meets} having all \hyperref[D1.81]{joins}, if we are able to prove that having all \hyperref[D1.81]{joins} means having all \hyperref[D1.81]{meets} in the original preorder).
    \item Suppose there are all \hyperref[D1.81]{joins} and $A \subseteq P$ is a subset for which we want the meet.
    \item Consider the set $M_A := \{p \in P\ |\ \forall a \in A: p \leq a \}$ (everything below all of $A$ - these are candidates for the \hyperref[D1.81]{meet} of $A$)
    \item The first condition for the \hyperref[D1.81]{meet} is satisfied by all. We get the actual \hyperref[D1.81]{meet} by \,taking $\bigvee M_A$ which is guaranteed to exist\,. Because this element \,is greater than or equal to all elements that are $\leq A$\,, it satisfies the second condition for the \hyperref[D1.81]{meet}.
