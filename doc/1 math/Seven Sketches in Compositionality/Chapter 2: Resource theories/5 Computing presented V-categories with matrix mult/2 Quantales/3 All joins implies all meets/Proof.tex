\begin{itemize}
    \item  \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 1: Generative Effects/5 Meets and joins/1 Definition and basic examples/Meet and join}{Meets and joins} are dual, so it suffices to prove one of the directions (the \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 2: Resource theories/4 Constructions on V-categories/2 Enriched functors/4 Exercise 2-73}{opposite category} shows that having all \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 1: Generative Effects/5 Meets and joins/1 Definition and basic examples/Meet and join}{meets} having all \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 1: Generative Effects/5 Meets and joins/1 Definition and basic examples/Meet and join}{joins}, if we are able to prove that having all \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 1: Generative Effects/5 Meets and joins/1 Definition and basic examples/Meet and join}{joins} means having all \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 1: Generative Effects/5 Meets and joins/1 Definition and basic examples/Meet and join}{meets} in the original preorder).
    \item Suppose there are all \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 1: Generative Effects/5 Meets and joins/1 Definition and basic examples/Meet and join}{joins} and $A \subseteq P$ is a subset for which we want the meet.
    \item Consider the set $M_A := \{p \in P\ |\ \forall a \in A: p \leq a \}$ (everything below all of $A$ - these are candidates for the \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 1: Generative Effects/5 Meets and joins/1 Definition and basic examples/Meet and join}{meet} of $A$)
    \item The first condition for the \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 1: Generative Effects/5 Meets and joins/1 Definition and basic examples/Meet and join}{meet} is satisfied by all. We get the actual \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 1: Generative Effects/5 Meets and joins/1 Definition and basic examples/Meet and join}{meet} by \,taking $\bigvee M_A$ which is guaranteed to exist\,. Because this element \,is greater than or equal to all elements that are $\leq A$\,, it satisfies the second condition for the \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 1: Generative Effects/5 Meets and joins/1 Definition and basic examples/Meet and join}{meet}.
