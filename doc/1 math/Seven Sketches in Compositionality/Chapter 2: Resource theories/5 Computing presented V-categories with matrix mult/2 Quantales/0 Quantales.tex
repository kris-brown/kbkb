\begin{itemize}
    \item Think of a \hyperref[D2.90]{unital, commutative, quantale} as a kind of navigator.
          \begin{itemize}
            \item A navigator understands 'getting from one place to another'
            \item Different navigators understand different aspects (whether one can get from \emph{A} to \emph{B}, how much time it will take, ...)
            \item What they share in common is that, given routes \emph{A} to \emph{B} and \emph{B} to \emph{C}, they understand how to get a route \emph{A} to \emph{C}.
          \end{itemize}
    \item Because of \hyperref[P2.96]{Proposition 2.96}, a quantale has all \hyperref[D1.81]{meets and joins} (even though we define it simply as having all joins).
  \end{itemize}
