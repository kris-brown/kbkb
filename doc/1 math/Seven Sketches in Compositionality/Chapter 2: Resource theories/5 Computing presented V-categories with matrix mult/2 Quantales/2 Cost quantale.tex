\begin{itemize}
    \item  We saw that \textbf{Cost} is \hyperref[D2.79]{monoidal closed} in \hyperref[X2.83]{Example 2.83}
    \item To check if \textbf{Cost} is a \hyperref[D2.90]{quantale}, we take an arbitrary set of elements and ask \,if it has a \hyperref[D1.81]{join}\,.
    \item Because $\geq$ is a total order, we can take \,the \emph{infimum} or greatest lower bound, as the \hyperref[D1.81]{join}.
          \begin{itemize}
            \item $\bigvee\{2.5,2.05,2.005,...\} = 2$.
          \end{itemize}\,
    \item We need a $0$, \,which is something which is related to everything (the first \hyperref[D1.81]{join} condition is vacuous). Because the preorder relation is $\geq$ in \textbf{Cost} we need something greater than everything, so $0 = \infty$\,.
    \item Thus \textbf{Cost} is a \hyperref[D2.90]{quantale}.
  \end{itemize}
