    \item  We saw that \textbf{Cost} is \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 2: Resource theories/5 Computing presented V-categories with matrix mult/1 Monoidal closed preorders/1 Closed SMP}{monoidal closed} in \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 2: Resource theories/5 Computing presented V-categories with matrix mult/1 Monoidal closed preorders/3 Cost is closed}{Example 2.83}
    \item To check if \textbf{Cost} is a \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 2: Resource theories/5 Computing presented V-categories with matrix mult/2 Quantales/1 Quantale}{quantale}, we take an arbitrary set of elements and ask \,if it has a \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 1: Generative Effects/5 Meets and joins/1 Definition and basic examples/Meet and join}{join}\,.
    \item Because $\geq$ is a total order, we can take \,the \emph{infimum} or greatest lower bound, as the \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 1: Generative Effects/5 Meets and joins/1 Definition and basic examples/Meet and join}{join}.
          \begin{itemize}
            \item $\bigvee\{2.5,2.05,2.005,...\} = 2$.
          \end{itemize}\,
    \item We need a $0$, \,which is something which is related to everything (the first \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 1: Generative Effects/5 Meets and joins/1 Definition and basic examples/Meet and join}{join} condition is vacuous). Because the preorder relation is $\geq$ in \textbf{Cost} we need something greater than everything, so $0 = \infty$\,.
    \item Thus \textbf{Cost} is a \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 2: Resource theories/5 Computing presented V-categories with matrix mult/2 Quantales/1 Quantale}{quantale}.
