\begin{itemize}
    \item  We proved one direction in \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 2: Resource theories/5 Computing presented V-categories with matrix mult/1 Monoidal closed preorders/5 SMP currying}{P2.87}
    \item We need to show that $(v \otimes \bigvee A)\cong  \bigvee_{a \in A} v \otimes a$ (and all joins existing) implies that there exists a $\multimap$ operation that satisfies the \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 2: Resource theories/5 Computing presented V-categories with matrix mult/1 Monoidal closed preorders/1 Closed SMP}{closed property}: $\forall a,v,w \in V: (a \otimes v) \leq w$ iff $a \leq (v \multimap w)$.
    \item The \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 1: Generative Effects/6 Galois connections/3 Basic theory of Galois connections/3 Adjoint functor theorem for preorders/Adjoint functor theorem for preorders}{adjoint functor theorem for preorders} states that \,\href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 1: Generative Effects/4 Monotone maps/1 Monotone map}{monotone maps} preserve \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 1: Generative Effects/5 Meets and joins/1 Definition and basic examples/Meet and join}{joins} iff they're left adjoint\,, so $V \xrightarrow{-\otimes v} V$ must have \,a right adjoint \emph{g}, which, being a \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 1: Generative Effects/6 Galois connections/1 Definition and examples/Galois connection}{Galois connection}, will satisfy the property $(a \otimes v) \leq w \iff a \leq g(w)$ (this is the \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 2: Resource theories/5 Computing presented V-categories with matrix mult/1 Monoidal closed preorders/1 Closed SMP}{monoidal closed} property)\,.
    \item Let's rename \,$g \equiv v \multimap -$\,. The adjoint functor theorem even gives us a construction for the right adjoint, namely: \,$v \multimap w:=\bigvee\{a \in V\ |\ a \otimes v \leq w\}$\,.
