Suppose $\mathcal{V}=(V,\leq,I,\otimes)$ is a \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 2: Resource theories/2 Symmetric monoidal preorders/1 Definition and first examples/1 Symmetric monoidal structure on a preorder}{symmetric monoidal preorder} that has all \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 1: Generative Effects/5 Meets and joins/1 Definition and basic examples/Meet and join}{joins}.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Then $\mathcal{V}$ is \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 2: Resource theories/5 Computing presented V-categories with matrix mult/1 Monoidal closed preorders/1 Closed SMP}{closed}, i.e. has a $\multimap$ operation and hence is a \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 2: Resource theories/5 Computing presented V-categories with matrix mult/2 Quantales/1 Quantale}{quantale}, iff $\otimes$ distributes over \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 1: Generative Effects/5 Meets and joins/1 Definition and basic examples/Meet and join}{joins}
      \item i.e. if \href{doc/1 math/Seven Sketches in Compositionality/Chapter 2: Resource theories/5 Computing presented V-categories with matrix mult/1 Monoidal closed preorders/5 SMP currying}{Eq (2) from P2.87} holds:  $(v \otimes \bigvee A)\cong  \bigvee_{a \in A} v \otimes a$.
