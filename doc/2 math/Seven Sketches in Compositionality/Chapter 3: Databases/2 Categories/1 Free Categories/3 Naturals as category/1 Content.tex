\begin{itemize}
    \item The natural numbers as a \ref{Free category on a graph|free category|referenced}: $\boxed{\overset{\bullet}{z}\circlearrowleft s}$
    \item There are \,infinitely\, many paths, in bijection with \,the natural numbers\,.
    \item This is a \ref{Category|category|referenced} with one object, also called a \emph{monoid}.
    \item The composition operation corresponds to \,the addition operation\,.
    \item Unitality and associativity give us the usual constraints on a monoid.
