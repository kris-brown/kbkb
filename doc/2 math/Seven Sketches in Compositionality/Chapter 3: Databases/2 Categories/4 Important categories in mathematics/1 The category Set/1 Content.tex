The \emph{category of sets}, denoted \textbf{Set}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Objects are the collection of all sets.
    \item Morphisms are set-functions
    \item Composition is function composition (satsifies associativity), identities are the identity functions (satisfies identity constraints).
    \item Closely related is the subcategory \textbf{FinSet} of finite sets with morphisms being set-functions.

  \end{itemize}
