A monoid in which every morphism is an \ref{Isomorphism|isomorphism|referenced} is known as a \emph{group}
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Is the \ref{Naturals as category|natural numbers monoid|referenced} a group?
      \item  Is the monoid with the added constraint $s;s=z$  a group?
    \end{enumerate}
