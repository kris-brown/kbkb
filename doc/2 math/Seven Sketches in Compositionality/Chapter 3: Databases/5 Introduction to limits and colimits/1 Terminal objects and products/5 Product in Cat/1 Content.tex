The product of two categories $\mathcal{C}\times \mathcal{D}$ may be given as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $Ob(C\times D)$ are \,the pairs $(c,d)$ where \emph{c} is an object of $\mathcal{C}$ and \emph{d} is an object of $\mathcal{D}$\,.
  \item Morphisms are \,pairs $(c,d)\xrightarrow{(f,g)}(c',d')$ where $c \xrightarrow{f}c'$ is a morphism in $\mathcal{C}$ and $d \xrightarrow{g}d'$ is a morphism in $\mathcal{D}$\,.
  \item Composition is given by \,composing each entry in the pair separately\,.
\end{itemize}
