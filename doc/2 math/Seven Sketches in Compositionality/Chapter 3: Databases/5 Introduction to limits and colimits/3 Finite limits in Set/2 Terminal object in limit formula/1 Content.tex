\begin{itemize}
    \item  With respect to \ref{Limit formula|Proposition 3.95|referenced}, if $\mathcal{J}=0$, then $n=0$; there are no vertices.
    \item There is exactly one empty tuple which vacuously satisfies the properties, so we've constructed the limit as the \,singleton set $\{()\}$ consisting of just the empty tuple\,.
    \item Thus the limit of the empty diagram, i.e. the terminal object in \textbf{Set}, is \,the singleton set\,.
