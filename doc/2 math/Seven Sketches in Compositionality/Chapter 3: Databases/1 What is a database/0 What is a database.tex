\begin{itemize}
    \item A database is a system of interlocking tables.
    \item Some columns are internal references (i.e. \emph{foreign keys}), others are external references (string, int, etc.).
          \begin{itemize}
            \item Changing the internal reference value doesn't mean anything (if we do it consistently), but not for the external references.
          \end{itemize}
    \item Category theory provides a mathmetical approach for translating between two different database representations of a common domain.
  \end{itemize}
