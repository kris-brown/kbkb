\begin{itemize}
    \item There is a \ref{Prop|prop|referenced} \textbf{Rel}
    \item Morphisms are relations $R \subseteq \bar m \times \bar n$
    \item Composition with $S \subseteq \bar n \times \bar p$ is
          \begin{itemize}
            \item $\{(i, k)\ |\  \exists (i, j) \in R \land \exists (j,k) \in S\}$
          \end{itemize}
    \item Monoidal product is given by the coproduct, which amounts to placing the two relations side-by-side.
