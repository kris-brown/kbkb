\begin{itemize}
    \item A $(2,3)$ \ref{Port graph|port-graph|referenced}. [Draw this]
    \item Since the overall type is $(2,3)$ we know we need a box with two overall inputs and three overall outputs.
    \item There are three internal boxes, meaning the vertex set is $\{a, b, c\}$.
    \item $in(a)=1$ and $out(a)=3$ which tells us to draw one port on the LHS and three on the RHS.
    \item The bijection $i$ tells us how the ports are connected by wires.
    \item [TODO Draw this]
    \item The acyclic internal flow graph is shown below [TODO Draw this]
