\begin{itemize}
    \item Categorification of arithmetic using the category \textbf{FinSet}
    \item Replace natural numbers with \,arbtirary sets of that cardinality\,.
    \item Replace $+$ with \,coproduct\,.
    \item This is good categorification because, with replacements, \,arithmatic truths are preserved: $\bar{5}\sqcup \bar{3} \cong \bar{8}$\,

  \end{itemize}
