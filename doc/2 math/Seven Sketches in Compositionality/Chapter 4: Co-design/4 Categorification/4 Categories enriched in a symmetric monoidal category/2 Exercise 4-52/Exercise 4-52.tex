Recall the \ref{Set as SMC|example|referenced} with \textbf{Set} as a symmetric moniodal category. Apply the definition of a $\mathcal{V}$ \ref{Enrichment in a SMC|category|referenced} and see if this agrees with the definition of an ordinary \ref{Category|category|referenced}. Is there a subtle difference?
