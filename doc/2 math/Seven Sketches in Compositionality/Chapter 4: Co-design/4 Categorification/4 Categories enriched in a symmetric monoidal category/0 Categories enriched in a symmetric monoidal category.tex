\begin{itemize}
    \item We said that ordinary categories were just \textbf{Set}-categories, but our definition of $\mathcal{V}$ categories required the $\mathcal{V}$ to be a preorder!
    \item We have to generalize (categorify) $\mathcal{V}$ categories.
    \item Symmetric monoidal preorders can be considered as symmetric monoidal categories, despite not providing the data for identities and composition (these are not needed because there is no choice).
          \begin{itemize}
            \item Example of property becoming structure: $I \leq \mathcal{X}(x,x)$ is a property of $\mathcal{V}$ \ref{V-category|categories as defined earlier|referenced} but become part of the structure in the \ref{Enrichment in a SMC|categorified version of the definition|referenced}.
          \end{itemize}
