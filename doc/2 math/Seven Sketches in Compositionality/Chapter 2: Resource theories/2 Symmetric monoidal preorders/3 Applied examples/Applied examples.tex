            \item As discussed here, we consider 'static' notions.
            \item Chemistry: reactants + catalyst $<$ products + catalyst
            \item Manufacturing: you can trash anything you want, and it disappears from view (requires $\forall x: x \leq I$)
            \item Informatics: in addition to trashing, information can be copied (requires $x \leq x + x$)
          \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
