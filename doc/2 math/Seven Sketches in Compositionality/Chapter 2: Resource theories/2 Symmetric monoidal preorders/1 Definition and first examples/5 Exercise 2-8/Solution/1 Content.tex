\begin{itemize}
    \item Monotonicity is the only tricky one, and is addressed due to the triviality of the discrete preorder.
          \begin{itemize}
            \item We can replace $x \leq y$ with $x \leq x$ because it is a discrete preorder.
            \item $x_1 \leq x_1 \land x_2 \leq x_2 \implies x_1 \otimes x_2 \leq x_1 \otimes x_2$
            \item $True \land True \implies True$ is vacuously true due to reflexivity of preorder.
          \end{itemize}
    \item Unitality/associativity comes from unitality/associativity of monoid
    \item Symmetry comes from commutitivity of monoid.

  \end{itemize}
