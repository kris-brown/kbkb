  \begin{itemize}
    \item Monotonicity: $x_1 \leq y_1 \land x_2 \leq y_2 \implies x_1x_2 \leq y_1y_2$
          \begin{itemize}
            \item  Suppose without loss of generality that $x_1\leq x_2$
            \item then $x_1x_2=x_1$ and $y_1y_2 = y_1$ or $y_2$
            \item In the first case, we know this is true because we assumed $x_1 \leq y_1$
            \item In the second case, we know it from transitivity: $x_1 \leq x_2\leq y_2$
          \end{itemize}
    \item Unitality: $min(x,yes)=x$
    \item Associativity: probably
    \item Symmetry: table is symmetric.
