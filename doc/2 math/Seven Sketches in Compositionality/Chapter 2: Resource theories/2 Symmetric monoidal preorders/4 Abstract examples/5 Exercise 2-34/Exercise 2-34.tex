\begin{itemize}
    \item  Consider the preorder defined by the Hasse diagram $\boxed{no \rightarrow maybe \rightarrow yes}$
    \item Consider a potential \ref{Symmetric monoidal structure on a preorder|monoidal structure|referenced} with $yes$ as the unit and $min$ as the product.
    \item Fill out a reasonable definition of $min$ and check that it satisfies the \ref{Symmetric monoidal structure on a preorder|conditions|referenced}.
