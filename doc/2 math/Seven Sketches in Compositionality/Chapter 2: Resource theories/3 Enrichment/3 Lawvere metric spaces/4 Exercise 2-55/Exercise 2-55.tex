Consider the \ref{Symmetric monoidal structure on a preorder|symmetric monoidal preorder|referenced} $(\mathbb{R},\geq,0,+)$ which is the same as \textbf{Cost} but does not include $\infty$. How do you characterize the difference between this and a \ref{Lawvere metric space|Lawvere metric space|referenced} in the sense of definition \ref{V-category|2.46|referenced}?
