\begin{itemize}
    \item Can convert any weighted graph into a \ref{Lawvere metric space|Lawvere metric space|referenced}, where a the distance is the sum of weights along the shortest path.
    \item It can be hard to see the shortest path by inspection, but a matrix power iteration method (starting from just a matrix of edge weights) is possible.
