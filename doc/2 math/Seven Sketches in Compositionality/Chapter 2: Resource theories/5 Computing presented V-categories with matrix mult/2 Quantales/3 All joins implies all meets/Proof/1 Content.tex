\begin{itemize}
    \item  \ref{Meet and join|Meets and joins|referenced} are dual, so it suffices to prove one of the directions (the \ref{Exercise 2-73|opposite category|referenced} shows that having all \ref{Meet and join|meets|referenced} having all \ref{Meet and join|joins|referenced}, if we are able to prove that having all \ref{Meet and join|joins|referenced} means having all \ref{Meet and join|meets|referenced} in the original preorder).
    \item Suppose there are all \ref{Meet and join|joins|referenced} and $A \subseteq P$ is a subset for which we want the meet.
    \item Consider the set $M_A := \{p \in P\ |\ \forall a \in A: p \leq a \}$ (everything below all of $A$ - these are candidates for the \ref{Meet and join|meet|referenced} of $A$)
    \item The first condition for the \ref{Meet and join|meet|referenced} is satisfied by all. We get the actual \ref{Meet and join|meet|referenced} by \,taking $\bigvee M_A$ which is guaranteed to exist\,. Because this element \,is greater than or equal to all elements that are $\leq A$\,, it satisfies the second condition for the \ref{Meet and join|meet|referenced}.
  \end{itemize}
