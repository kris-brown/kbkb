\begin{itemize}
    \item Think of a \ref{Quantale|unital, commutative, quantale|referenced} as a kind of navigator.
          \begin{itemize}
            \item A navigator understands 'getting from one place to another'
            \item Different navigators understand different aspects (whether one can get from \emph{A} to \emph{B}, how much time it will take, ...)
            \item What they share in common is that, given routes \emph{A} to \emph{B} and \emph{B} to \emph{C}, they understand how to get a route \emph{A} to \emph{C}.
          \end{itemize}
    \item Because of \ref{All joins implies all meets|Proposition 2.96|referenced}, a quantale has all \ref{Meet and join|meets and joins|referenced} (even though we define it simply as having all joins).
  \end{itemize}
