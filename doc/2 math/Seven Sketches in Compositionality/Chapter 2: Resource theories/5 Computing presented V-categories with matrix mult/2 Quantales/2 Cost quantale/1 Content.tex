\begin{itemize}
    \item  We saw that \textbf{Cost} is \ref{Closed SMP|monoidal closed|referenced} in \ref{Cost is closed|Example 2.83|referenced}
    \item To check if \textbf{Cost} is a \ref{Quantale|quantale|referenced}, we take an arbitrary set of elements and ask \,if it has a \ref{Meet and join|join|referenced}\,.
    \item Because $\geq$ is a total order, we can take \,the \emph{infimum} or greatest lower bound, as the \ref{Meet and join|join|referenced}.
          \begin{itemize}
            \item $\bigvee\{2.5,2.05,2.005,...\} = 2$.
          \end{itemize}\,
    \item We need a $0$, \,which is something which is related to everything (the first \ref{Meet and join|join|referenced} condition is vacuous). Because the preorder relation is $\geq$ in \textbf{Cost} we need something greater than everything, so $0 = \infty$\,.
    \item Thus \textbf{Cost} is a \ref{Quantale|quantale|referenced}.
  \end{itemize}
