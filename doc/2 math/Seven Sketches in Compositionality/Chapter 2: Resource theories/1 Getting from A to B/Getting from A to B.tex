\begin{itemize}
    \item Want to be able to answer questions about \emph{resources} like:
          \begin{itemize}
            \item Given what I have, is it \emph{possible} to get what I want?
            \item Given what I have, what is the \emph{minimum cost} to get what I want?
            \item Given what I have, what is the \emph{set of ways} to get what I want?\end{itemize}
    \item Monoidal preorders will allow us to build new recipes from old ones.
    \item Resources are not always consumed when used.
    \item  A $\mathcal{V}$ \ref{V-category|category|referenced} is a set of objects, which one may think of as points on a map
          \begin{itemize}
            \item  $\mathcal{V}$ somehow 'structures the question' of getting from point \emph{a} to \emph{b}
            \item  $\mathcal{V} = Bool$ answers the question of whether we can get to \emph{b}
            \item  $\mathcal{V} = Cost$ can help answer how to get to \emph{b} with minimum cost.
            \item  $\mathcal{V} = \mathbf{Set}$ can yield a set of methods to get to \emph{b}.\end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
