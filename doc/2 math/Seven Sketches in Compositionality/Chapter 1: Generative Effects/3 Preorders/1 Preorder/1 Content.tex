A \emph{preorder} / \emph{partial order} / \emph{total order} \ref{Relation|relation|referenced} on a set $X$

\begin{itemize}
    \item Preorder: a binary relation on $X$ that is reflexive and transitive.
    \item A partial order (poset) has the additional constraint that $x \leq y \land y \leq x \implies x=y$
          \begin{itemize}\item We can always get a partial order from a preorder by \ref{Quotient|quotienting|referenced}, so it's not that special.\end{itemize}
    \item A total order has all elements comparable.
  \end{itemize}
