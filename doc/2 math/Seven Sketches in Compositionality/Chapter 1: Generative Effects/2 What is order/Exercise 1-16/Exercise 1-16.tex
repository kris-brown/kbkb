Suppose $A$ is a \ref{Partition|partitioned set|referenced} and $P,Q$ are two \ref{Partition|partitions|referenced} such that for each $p \in P$ there exists a $q \in Q$ with $A_p=A_q$
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Show that for each $p \in P$ there is at most one $q \in Q$ such that $A_p = A_q$
      \item Show that for each $q \in Q$ there is a $p \in P$ such that $A_p = A_q$
    \end{enumerate}
