\begin{itemize}
    \item Category theory emphasizes that \ref{Preorder|preorders|referenced} themselves (each a minature world, composed of many relationships) can be related to one another.
    \item \ref{Monotone map|Monotone maps|referenced} are important because they are the right notion of \emph{structure-preserving map} for preorders.
    \item The map (`cardinality') sending a power-set (with inclusion ordering) to the natural numbers with standard ordering is a \ref{Monotone map|monotone map|referenced}.
    \item Given a \ref{Preorder|preorder|referenced}, the inclusion map of the \ref{Upper set|upper sets|referenced} of $P$ (ordered by inclusion) to the power set of $P$ (ordered by inclusion) is a \ref{Monotone map|monotone map|referenced}.
