\begin{itemize}
    \item Examples of closure operators from logic.
    \item Take set of all propositions as a preorder, where $p \leq q$ iff $p$ implies $q$.
    \item Some modal operators are closure operators
    \item E.g. $j(p)$ means ``Assuming Bob is in Chicago, \emph{p}''
          \begin{itemize}
            \item \,$p \implies j(p)$ (the logic is monotonic, adding assumptions does not make something true into something false\,.
            \item \,$j(j(p)) = j(p)$ (the assumption is idempotent)\,
          \end{itemize}
