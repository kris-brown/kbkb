\begin{itemize}
    \item Example of a \ref{Closure operator|closure operator|referenced}
    \item Think of the preorder of arithmatic expressions such as $12, 4+2+4, 9*(2+3)$, where the $\leq$ operators denotes whether \,an expression can be simplified to another\,.
    \item A computer program $j$ that evaluates expressions is \,a \ref{Monotone map|monotonic|referenced} function on the preorder to itself\, (if you can reduce \emph{x} to \emph{y}, then $j(x)$ should be able to be rewritten as $j(y)$.
    \item The requirements of closure operator say that $j$ should be a simplification, and \,that trying to reduce an expression which has already been reduced will do nothing further\,.
