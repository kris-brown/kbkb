\begin{itemize}
    \item  Let $m = \bigwedge A$ and $n = \bigwedge B$.
    \item For any $a \in A$ we also have $a \in B$, so $n \leq A$ because $n$ is a lower bound for $B$.
    \item Thus $n$ is also a lower bound for $A$ and hence $n \leq m$ because $m$ is $A$'s greatest lower bound.
  \end{itemize}
