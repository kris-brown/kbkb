\begin{itemize}
  \item  We are comparing the observation of a combined system or the combination of observations.
  \item The other direction, restricting an observation of a system to a subsystem, does not have problems for \ref{Monotone map|monotone maps|referenced} (which preserve \ref{Meet and join|meets|referenced}, not \ref{Meet and join|joins|referenced}).
