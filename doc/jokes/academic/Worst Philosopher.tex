Back in the 50's, Wittgenstein was not a respectable figure in analytic
philosophy. I mean, to a large extent, he still isn't. The claim is that the
Rutgers philosophy department voted on who the worst philosopher was (the one
who done the most damage in the 20th century), and Wittgenstein was the answer.
In a blog by one of the Rutgers faculty, it said: this is an apocryphal story;
it didn't really happen. But if we had held such a vote, that would have been
the result.
