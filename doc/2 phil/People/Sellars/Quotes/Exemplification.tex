``Exemplification is a quasi-semantical relation, and it (and universals
\footnote{redness, lionhood}) is in the world only in that broad sense in which the

    \item This plays off Carnap's notion of `quasi-syntactical'.
    \item There's the narrow view of `the world', that's the world that science
          is the measure of all things. And the broader view of the world.
\end{itemize}
