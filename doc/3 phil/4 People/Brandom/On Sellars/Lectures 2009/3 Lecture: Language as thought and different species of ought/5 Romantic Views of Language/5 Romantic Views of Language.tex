People with romantic views of language: \ref{derrida|Derrida|reference} and \ref{nietzsche|Nietzsche|reference}. These are compatible with Wittgenstein \ref{downtown|believing language has no downtown|reference}.

Sellars disagrees: the language-language inferential transitions are of the first importance among those because what makes the entries and exits \emph{language} entries and exits is the way they connect to the inferential moves. And so he would say to Derrida, ``yes, we do all of these other wonderful things with the language, but that's all parasitic on the meanings that things are given because of the role they play in the space of reasons... now, once you've got that up and running, once you've got those meanings to work with, now you can start to do other playful things with it, e.g. use them metaphorically. All sorts of things become possible. But that's in principle a superstructure on this structure."
