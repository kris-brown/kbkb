Rousseau said ``Obedience to a law that one has laid oneself is freedom''. Kant turned this around to distinguish constraint by norms from constraint by power. Where natural things are bound by rules, we are bound by our conceptions of rules (i.e. to the extent we acknowledge them). Our normative status depend on our attitudes.
