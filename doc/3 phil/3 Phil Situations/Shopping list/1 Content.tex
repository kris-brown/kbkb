A man has arrived at the grocery store to go shopping, but realizes he's forgotten his shopping list. Unbenknownst to him, a spy is following him tasked with writing a list of everything that is put into the grocery cart. There are now two lists of groceries that have dual relationships to what is put into the cart:

\begin{itemize}
\item The original shopping list: \begin{itemize}
\item If we want to know whether an item that is put into the cart is `correct', we must look to the shopping list
\item This list has \emph{authority} over what is put into the cart: the list sets the standards of correctness.
\end{itemize}
\item The spy's list: \begin{itemize}
\item This, conversely, says nothing about what should be put into the cart.
\item If we want to know whether something written on the list is `correct', we must look to the shopping cart.
\item The cart has \emph{authority} over the spy's list.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
