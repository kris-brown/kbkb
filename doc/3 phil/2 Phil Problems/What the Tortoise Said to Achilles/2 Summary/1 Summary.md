- The Tortoise assumes a proposition $p$ and a \ref{material_conditional|material conditional|} $p \implies q$.
  - The exact $p$ and $q$ aren't important to the moral of the story, though it's something like "If $A=B$ and $B=C$ ($p$), then $A=C$ ($q$)"
  - The Tortoise is playing a game: I'll do anything you tell me to do, *so long as you make explicit* the rule you're asking me to follow.
- Achilles tries to convince the Tortoise to accept $q$.
  - He says that logic \emph{obliges} you to acknowledge $q$ in this case.
- The Tortoise is willing to go along with this but demands that this rule be made explicit:
  - Achilles adds an extra axiom: $p \land (p \implies q) \implies q$.
- Achilles says that, now, you *really* have to accept $q$, given that you're committed to:
  - $p$
  - $p \implies q$
  - $p \land (p \implies q) \implies q$.

- But the Tortoise notes that, if taking those three propositions and concluding $q$ is really something logic obliges one to do, then it bears writing down:
  - $p \land (p \implies q) \land (p \land (p \implies q)) \implies q$

- This can go ad infinitum; the Tortoise wins.
