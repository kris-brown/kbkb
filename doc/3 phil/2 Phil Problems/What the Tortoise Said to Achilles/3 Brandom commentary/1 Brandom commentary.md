- The most influential pragmatist work in the philosophy of logic.
- The lesson:
    - in any *particular* case, you can substitute a rule (that tells you you can go from this to that) with an axiom.
    - But there have got to be some moves you can make without having to explicitly license them by a principle.
    - I.e. you've got to distinguish between
            1.) premises from which to reason
            2.) principles in accordance with which to reason.

- This teaches an un-get-over-able lesson about the necessity for an *implicit practical background* of making some moves that are just okay. Things that would be put in a logical system, not in the forms of axioms, but in the form of rules.
