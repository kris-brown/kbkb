## TODO
[x] Latex to HTML
[x] Image rendering
[x] keyword parsing at the top (ORD, GIST, TAGS, TEX) would be good. Any more?
    - ORD is used to order the files/directories within a folder. 1-2-3-3.5-4, etc.
    - GIST used for [Hovertext](https://www.w3docs.com/snippets/html/how-to-add-a-mouseover-text-with-html.html )
    - TAGS could be like "def" / "exercise"
    - TEX could specify nondefault things to compile LaTeX with
[x] Table of contents rendering
[x] References handling
[x] Collapsible subsections
[x] Up / Prev / Next HTML buttons
[] hover text
[] color code based on tag
[] List of other pages that link to the current page (and for each subsection?
  would need to make that togglable)
[] 'Home page' (with overall ToC, search bar, references, ABOUT, filters)
    - search
    - filter by definition / proposition
[] comment system + postgres
